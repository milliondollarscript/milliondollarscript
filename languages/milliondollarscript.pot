These snapshots are created periodically at points in the \"dev\" branch while working towards the next release when it's thought to be somewhat more stable and new features are finished and ready for testing.<br /><br /><strong>Development</strong> - This is the \"dev\" branch. This is where the development happens. This branch contains new and untested code for the next release. There are almost certainly bugs, and it may not work at all and could completely break your site. Only use this if you know what you're doing.
